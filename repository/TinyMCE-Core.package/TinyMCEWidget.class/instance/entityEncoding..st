entityEncoding: aString
  "entity_encoding

This option controls how entities/characters get processed by TinyMCE. The value can be set as shown in Encoding Types below. You can also mix named and numeric by setting this to 'named+numeric' this way it will produce entity names of the ones found in the configured entities and numeric entities for other entities.

The base entities < > & ' and quot will always be entity encoded into their named equivalents. Though ' and quot will only be encoded within attribute values and < > will only be encoded within text nodes. This is correct according too the HTML and XML specs.

Encoding Types

Name	Summary
named	Characters will be converted into named entities based on the entities option. For example, a non-breaking space could be encoded as &nbsp;. This value is default.
numeric	Characters will be converted into numeric entities. For example, a non-breaking space would be encoded as &#160;.
raw	All characters will be stored in non-entity form except these XML default entities: & < > quot
