  "allow_unsafe_link_target

By default all links with a target of _blank will get a rel attribute of noopener noreferrer. This will disable access to the window.opener object from a child tab/window that will open on click. If this is not something you care about, you can disable this option, by setting it to false. Although we do not recommend you to do so!
